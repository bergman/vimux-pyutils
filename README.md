Vimux-pyutils
=============

This is a vim bundle containing some additional, python-specific, functions
on top of vimux :
https://github.com/benmills/vimux/

This plugin allow to select a block of python code in vim and send it to the
vimux tmux split. The assumption is that ipython is running in said tmux split
and this allow to execute a file chunk-by-chunk.

This is somewhat similar to the code block execution that can be found in
scientific software (for example Matlab).
